       Notes for upgrading this function:
           It is possible to add new constants.
           - DO NOT change the structure of the function, as well as its
               prototype.
           - DO NOT change the identifiers of the constants that have already
               been defined in this function. If you want to add a new
               constant, use an unused identifier.
           - DO NOT add constants that can be easily computed starting form
               other ones (avoid redundancy).
